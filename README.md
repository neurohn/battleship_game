Design a Battleship game( Battleship (puzzle) usually done in 90 minutes).

Design has to be in a way that, the player owns a set of ships and a board and ships are placed on the board.
Should be most flexible to adapt new modifications (Follow OOPS approach).
An armada can contain any combination of battleship(four units long), cruisers (three units long), destroyers (two units long) and submarines (one unit in size).
eg: The armada includes one battleship four units long, two cruisers three units long and two destroyers two units long.

For the problem, assume 9x9 board.
